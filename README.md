# CSCD210-Lab6
## Description
This Java program performs various operations on a positive integer provided by the user. It features a menu with options to:
- Enter a new number.
- Count the even, odd, and zero digits.
- Compare the digit average of the number with another (light/heavy).
- Approximate the mathematical constant e.
- Print the number in reverse.
Each operation is handled in separate methods for clarity. Input validation ensures only positive integers are accepted, and the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.
## How It Works
- The user starts by entering a positive number.
- The menu presents six options:
  - Enter a new number.
  - Count the even, odd, and zero digits in the number.
  - Compare the number with another number to check if it's "light" or "heavy."
  - Print an approximation of the value of e.
  - Print the number in reverse order.
  - Quit the program.
- Depending on the user's choice, the corresponding method from CSCD210Lab6Methods is called, and the result is displayed.
